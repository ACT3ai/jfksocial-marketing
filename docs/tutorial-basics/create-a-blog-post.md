# Creating Your Profile

Your JFKSocial profile is your identity on the Nostr network.

## Setting Up

When you first launch JFKSocial, you can either:

- **Generate new keys** - Creates a fresh Nostr identity
- **Import existing keys** - Use your existing nsec private key

## Profile Information

You can set the following on your profile:

- **Display name** - Your human-readable name
- **Username** - A short handle
- **Bio** - A brief description about yourself
- **Profile picture** - A URL to your avatar image
- **Banner image** - A URL for your profile banner
- **NIP-05 identifier** - A verified identity like `you@yourdomain.com`

## Key Management

Your private key (nsec) is the most important piece of your Nostr identity. Store it securely and never share it with anyone.

Your public key (npub) is safe to share -- it's how other people find and follow you.
