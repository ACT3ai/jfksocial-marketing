# Direct Messages

Send private, encrypted messages on JFKSocial.

## Encrypted DMs

JFKSocial supports NIP-04 encrypted direct messages. Your messages are encrypted using the recipient's public key, meaning only they can read them.

## Sending a DM

1. Navigate to the Messages section
2. Start a new conversation by entering the recipient's npub
3. Type your message and send

## Privacy Considerations

While the content of NIP-04 DMs is encrypted, the metadata (who is messaging whom) is visible on relays. Keep this in mind for sensitive communications.

:::tip

For the highest level of privacy, consider using relays you trust for your DM traffic.

## Group Conversations

Nostr is evolving support for group messaging. JFKSocial will add support for new messaging NIPs as they mature and gain adoption across the ecosystem.
