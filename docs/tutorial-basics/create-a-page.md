# Following and Feeds

Discover content and connect with people on the Nostr network.

## Following Users

To follow someone on JFKSocial:

1. Find their profile by searching their npub or NIP-05 identifier
2. Click the Follow button
3. Your contact list is updated and published to your relays

Your follow list is portable -- it works across all Nostr clients.

## Feed Types

JFKSocial provides several feed views:

- **Following** - Posts from people you follow, in chronological order
- **Global** - All posts from your connected relays
- **Notifications** - Mentions, replies, and reactions to your posts

## No Algorithms

Unlike centralized platforms, JFKSocial shows you posts in chronological order. No algorithmic manipulation, no promoted content, no engagement farming. Just posts from real people you chose to follow.
