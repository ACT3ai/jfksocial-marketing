# Welcome to JFKSocial

JFKSocial is a decentralized social media client built on the **Nostr protocol**. It gives you full ownership of your online identity and social connections.

## What is Nostr?

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol for decentralized social networking. Instead of relying on a single company's servers, Nostr uses a network of relays that anyone can run.

### Key Concepts

- **Keys, not accounts** - Your identity is a cryptographic key pair. Your public key is your username, your private key is your password. No email or phone number required.
- **Relays** - Servers that store and forward messages. You can connect to as many as you like, and switch between them freely.
- **NIPs** - Nostr Implementation Possibilities define how clients and relays communicate. They ensure interoperability across the ecosystem.

## Getting Started with JFKSocial

### 1. Create or Import Your Keys

If you're new to Nostr, JFKSocial will generate a key pair for you. If you already have a Nostr identity, you can import your existing private key (nsec).

### 2. Connect to Relays

JFKSocial comes with sensible default relays, but you can add, remove, or prioritize relays to customize your experience.

### 3. Start Posting

Publish notes, follow other users, send encrypted DMs, and explore the decentralized social web.

## Why JFKSocial?
