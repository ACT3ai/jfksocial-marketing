# Zaps and Lightning

Send and receive Bitcoin tips directly through Nostr using the Lightning Network.

## What Are Zaps?

Zaps (NIP-57) allow you to send Bitcoin payments (via the Lightning Network) to other Nostr users. It's a way to show appreciation for content you enjoy -- like a "like" button that sends real value.

## Setting Up Zaps

To receive zaps on JFKSocial:

1. Set up a Lightning wallet that supports LNURL (e.g., Alby, Wallet of Satoshi)
2. Add your Lightning address to your JFKSocial profile
3. Other users can now zap your posts

## Sending Zaps

To zap someone else's post:

1. Click the zap icon on any note
2. Choose an amount (in sats)
3. Confirm the payment through your Lightning wallet

## Why Zaps Matter

Zaps create a direct value exchange between creators and their audience. No middleman taking a cut, no minimum payout thresholds, no payment processing delays. Just instant, borderless micropayments.
