# About JFKSocial

JFKSocial is a decentralized social media platform built on the Nostr protocol.

## Our Mission

We believe social media should be open, censorship-resistant, and controlled by users rather than corporations. JFKSocial puts you in charge of your identity, your data, and your social connections.

## The Nostr Protocol

Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables a truly decentralized social network. Messages are signed with your cryptographic keys and published to relays -- servers that anyone can run. This means no single company controls the network.
