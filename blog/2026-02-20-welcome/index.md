Welcome to JFKSocial -- a new way to connect on the decentralized web.

<!-- truncate -->

We're building JFKSocial because we believe social media is broken. Centralized platforms control your identity, mine your data, and use algorithms to manipulate your attention. We think there's a better way.

## Why Nostr?

The Nostr protocol gives us everything we need to build truly decentralized social media:

- **Cryptographic identity** - No email, no phone number, no KYC. Just a key pair.
- **Relay architecture** - Messages are distributed across independent relays, making censorship practically impossible.
- **Interoperability** - Your JFKSocial profile works with every other Nostr client out there.

## What's Next

We're actively building JFKSocial and will be sharing updates here on the blog. Follow along as we ship new features, improve performance, and grow the community.

If you want to get involved, reach out on Nostr.
