New to Nostr? Here's everything you need to know to get started with JFKSocial.

## Step 1: Generate Your Keys

When you first open JFKSocial, you'll be given the option to generate a new key pair or import an existing one. If you're new, just generate fresh keys.

**Back up your private key (nsec) immediately.** Store it somewhere safe. If you lose it, you lose access to your identity forever. There is no "forgot password" on Nostr.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Profile

Add a display name, bio, and profile picture. This information is published as a Nostr event and will be visible across all Nostr clients.

## Step 3: Connect to Relays

JFKSocial connects to a set of default relays automatically. You can add or remove relays in Settings to customize your experience.

## Step 4: Follow People

Search for users by their public key (npub) or NIP-05 identifier (like an email-style address). Your follow list is stored on the relays you're connected to.

## Step 5: Start Posting

Write your first note and publish it to the network. It will be signed with your key and distributed across your connected relays.

Welcome to the decentralized social web.
