Centralized social media platforms have become the gatekeepers of online discourse. JFKSocial is our answer to that problem.

## The Problem with Centralized Platforms

Every major social media platform today is controlled by a single company. They decide who gets to speak, what content gets amplified, and how your data is used. When you sign up, you're handing over your identity, your social graph, and your content to a corporation.

## The Nostr Alternative

Nostr flips this model on its head:

- **You own your keys** - Your identity is a cryptographic key pair. No company can take it away.
- **You choose your relays** - Connect to relays you trust. Run your own if you want.
- **You keep your data** - Your posts are signed by your key, stored across multiple relays, and portable to any client.

## Building for the Future

With JFKSocial, we're building a client that makes decentralized social media accessible to everyone -- not just cypherpunks. Good UX shouldn't be exclusive to walled gardens.

Stay tuned for more updates on our progress.
